				<p>Made a responsive website using Html and CSS only. The website was created for a baking shop called TrufflePoint as the owner wanted to expand his business online and get more attention as possible. I created the website by first analyzing and using my UI skills to get all the information from the owner regarding the business and after analyzing we went for an Ecommerce site. With the help of
		        Ecommerce platform  he was able to sell his baking stuff and could take online orders for cakes and many more things.</p>

				</h3>
				<p>Created a webiste only using bootstrap elements. Bootstrap is a great source through which people can save a lot of time and make projects very easily. Incase you have a meeting and u were asked to get a mockup for the webiste, then Bootsrap is the best source for creating quick templates as a sample site and then can be later coded properly for the client. I Created a webite using bootstrap in which i talked about the usefulness of bootstrap and its different features./p>

				<h3>
					<a href="#" target="_blank" class="theme-color">Logo creation</a>
				</h3>
				<p>Using our skills to date, We were challanged by our professor to illustrate an avatar representing an animal. These graphics were done in vector format in all 3 major Apple dimensions. The graphics are scale-able, the small one was black and white with few detail, the medium one with color and more details, and the large one have gradients and all sorts of wildness. I chose to create an eagle which was my original design and i had the idea about how my eagle would look like as in my childhood i used to create anime characters and once i drew an eagle using my imagination. This eagle was the enhanced version of my older one and it came out to be perfect as i wanted. </p>
